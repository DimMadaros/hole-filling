# hole-filling
A project from Computational Geometry Class implementing a hole filling algorithm for 3d-models.

- Implemented using C++ and a proprietary library developed in the Visualisation and Virtual Reality Group of ECE UPatras.

- Scene creation for loading two hollow 3D objects.

- Collision detection of said objects and colouring of the triangles collided.

- Removal of intersected triangles in order to create the hollow parts of objects.

- Detection of hollow parts of one of the two objects.

- Smoothing of the hollow areas.

- Hole filling of said object using triangulation.

- Optimization of the mesh that cover every overlap area, in order to approximate the density of the surrounding mesh of the model.
